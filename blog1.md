Summary: This is an update on my life since I last wrote.... about 2 years summarized in a few paragraphs. 
# Hi there :) 
Hi, it’s me, Gen.

I haven’t written on this blog in the past 3 years. Life has happened, the good, the bad, and the flowing in-between. When I rediscovered this blog, I was struck that my last post was about my experience in the Bronx the first time I went in March of 2020. That was the start of a revolution in my life, that first trip to the Bronx in the name of Jesus as a Junior in college. A weird passion was lit in my heart, seemingly out of nowhere. This passion for that ugly and dysfunctional city, for finding Christ there, for being Christ there, for seeing Christ there.

# A note about me and passions
There is something that needs to be said about me. I am not someone who easily has burning passions, but I am someone who longs for, yearns for it. Most of the time I am chill, I love to talk with people about the heart stuff, and I am deeply reflective. I see how mission is incredibly powerful and personal drive for excellence is simply beautiful, but I am not one to find easily what I should do with “this wild & precious life”.
# God's plan, God's plan
Okay, so that’s the material that God is working with. & then. BOOM. passion for the BRONX out of all places and things.

So I find myself on this journey of saying yes. I knew that God put this love, this passion in me. And somehow I found the courage to follow, one step at a time. I was brought to leading that mission trip the following year for my peers. What a wonderful joy! When I think about that experience, I am deeply grateful for working with such an incredible man as a co leader. I learned so much from him and I don’t think I will really be hanging out with him again until heaven, but that just makes me really excited for it. What a concept: all the freakishly incredible people I have met throughout the years who love God so intently, so ardently, so authentically and are continuously coming more into themselves, all in one place, all in communion at the end of the race. Wild.

Through this saying yes, I landed in the mystery of moving to NYC ghetto 144th street with 4 strangers, 1 sister and a whole lot of having no idea what I was getting myself into, as I committed to volunteering in a charter school and teaching these children about the Good Lord at about 4pm every afternoon.
# Bronx, stage 1: "The Job Days"
OOOoowww there is so much I could say about that experience. So much mystery veils it. During that year, I was in deep distress about these children not receiving Jesus, me not being able to convey Him well. A deep agony was there from seeing a real need (for these students, hungry and hurting for God to actually meet Him) and trying to fill it (telling them about Jesus, being present to love on them), but feeling so inadequate at doing so (chaos in my classroom, not being able to connect, having to be the bad cop, the stressed authoritative figure). Oh deep agony. I was staring my poverty in the face. I was staring the poverty of our culture in the face. Powerlessness, despair, hopelessness were the temptations ever present.


This occasion was an occasion for faith to deepen beyond the visible, the sensible, the apparent, to the enduring and forever truths of God’s omnipotence and Goodness.
# Community Blessing me 
I failed at that faith for part of the year, battling through dryness and despair, and anger. But God taught me a lot. He strengthened me through ridiculous community, people who are so beautiful, so hearty, so pure, so LOVING & filled with him. They were like water in the desert. We called our community “Beloveds”. What a thing to repeat, to hammer into your mind as life is hard, suffering is hounding, discouragement is surrounding. BELOVED. oooowww.


Some things that carried me in this community: prayer room, family dinner, late night chats, guitar, couch chats. Being human and therefore spiritual as well, in company of people seeking the same goal; “in it” as we used to say. God, I am grateful for beautiful, God-loving people.
# A FREE Choice met with grace
Then a decision came: do I stay in the Bronx? And I decided the answer was “yes” even though it was very unclear. I wanted to stay and learn to teach and love God better here after healing from the bitterness that pledged me that first year. This yielded more growing, more stretching, more struggle. But I learned how tough I am, how much room I have for improvement, and how I really do have a lot of grit in me. I learned that God is present in the darkness, the darkness that comes from a faithless and lost culture, He’s present even there. So much of God’s work in that place is hidden, but He is there all the same, hidden or not. And I saw him in my heathen, whole-hearted coworkers who poured out with generosity and passion into these children’s lives. I saw Him in the parents of scholars, parents who cared, who were working all the time and fighting for hope for their children.

# Self Knowledge 
I realized some things about myself: my need for verbal processing of stress, my tendency to be self-reliant and how that leads to more struggle than necessary, and that I love to explore. Oh there was also a shift in the view I had of loving the young: you have to be hard on them if they are not able to choose the good, otherwise they will never learn to love and do what is good. That was a really difficult lesson for me as a teacher because I did not want to be a stern teacher, I was scared of being mean. What that resulted in was children thinking they could do whatever they wanted in my classroom. It resulted in them not feeling safe and taking their safety into their own hands. That lead to frequent verbal fights and occasional physical altercations. I wish I was better at being strict at the start, but I am just learning. One step at a time. Yah, this forced me to learn to be a lot more gentle with myself as I failed. I hated the feeling of failing at my job and that affecting lots of other people.

Throughout all of this, I received encouragement from a lot of people: my supervisor, my co teachers. So much kindness and mercy poured out from others. It was so needed. I found that this past year was constantly getting knocked down and choosing to get back up, again and again.

# Bright Spot
A bright spot in the year was training for my first 1/2 Marathon. I would have never agreed to do such a thing had I not been kinda tricked into it. You see, I told my friend Jess that I would train for a race with her. I was thinking like a 5k, you know 3 miles. But then she takes me up on my offer and asks to train for a 13 mile race. ha! What a time. Before I responded to her text, I was like “omg 13 miles? I haven’t run 1 mile in the past year… but I told her I do a race. And I’ve been meaning to get in shape for the past 10 years…hmm” So I committed to training. It was a wonderful bonding experience, as well as highly empowering to see how much I really am capable through slow, incremental progress. Thanks, Jess!


I got to go to Italy with my parents and sisters this spring. Oh Italy! I love it there, so much beauty for all the senses, such a delightfully human place.


& My brother got married. What a glorious weekend. It was a time where I very palpably felt God’s blessing.

# Recent Events, Grief & Struggle
The most recent events of my life have been the most challenging thus far. Within the span of 1 month, the month of May 2023, my mom, whom I love so dearly, whom I treasure, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, suffered abundantly, and died. The horror of life has been haunting me since. But it is mixed in with so much tender love from God through other people and so much beauty. It’s all mixed together. I know that God “conquers overwhelmingly” and to this I am clinging. I have been overwhelmed by the love of my friends and family, just as much as I have been weighed down by the tragedy of cancer destroying my mom’s body and stealing her life. I am still asking God to help me work through this.


# Awaiting the Light
And now, I am in this place of healing again, of grieving and of asking God to direct my steps. I hope He gives me a passion again, guides me… Clinging in trust and hoping that He’s not done yet.
