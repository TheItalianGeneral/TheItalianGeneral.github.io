Summary: ~ this blog is aimed at letting you into a section of my heart that was moved and changed, touched and effected by two conversations with two grey-haired women in NYC ~

# The Beginning 

On March 7, 2020, I climbed onto a Mega Bus in Pittsburgh, PA, which was heading to NYC. I boded that mustard yellow vehicle with uncertainty as to what was a head of me, besides a 8+hr bus ride. But I was in the company of 19 friends, with the same desire as me: to love and serve the poor. We headed from our small college in Ohio to one of the biggest cities in the world to encounter the people there. Our mission was simple: to see Jesus in the lonely and poor of NYC and to love them with His heart. 

# the happenstance of encountering

It was an incredible experience of seeing the beauty of humanity, even in the midst of brokenness and poverty. I left the Bronx with a greater love for humanity, the poor, Jesus Christ, New York City, and pop tarts.

When I try to tell people about this experience, there is a lot I can say. Ultimately, it is too much to say and try to explain in one sitting, one phone call, one block of time. Honestly there is always more to say, describe, explain, convey about the physical surrounding, each person I encountered, what happened in my heart as a result of those encounters, and what God spoke to me through them. 

But what I found myself reflecting on the most, and conveying to those who asked, was the happenstance of encountering two vastly different eighty-something-year-old women. (not AT ALL what I expected)

# a subway lady
The first was my friend Sandra. I met her on the Subway during a rush hour of afternoon travel.  I was in Manhattan at the time, traveling back to the Bronx. 

The subway car was packed full of silent people-- people plugged-up with AirPods, people in their own worlds---but in the same subway car, with barely 6 inches between them. 

I was holding onto a metle poll bracing myself for the jolt of the subway takeoff, when I noticed Sandra sitting on the seat in front of me. 

"How has your day been?" I said, looking at her in the eye. 

"Draining." 

with that one word, I entered into encountering this woman of old age, who was drained-- of life, of hope, of purpose, of joy.   
# poverty of heart
Through talking with Sandra, it became readily obvious to me that she was a grumpy old lady.  Soon after realizing this, I came to a deeper clarity, namely that Sandra did not value herself and did not feel loved. This became apparent to me when she told me, after meeting me a minute before, that she wanted her friends to shoot her if she lost her memory, as she assumed she would, since she was getting older and older by the day. Let me repeat that. She wanted her friends to shoot her. and she told that to a twenty year old woman on the subway, a minute after first meeting her. 

This deep despair shook me to the core. It was horrible, disgusting, hellish. 

"I told my friends to shoot me when I can't remember anything anymore." 

"That's terrible!" My eyes bulged from my head, and I took a step closer to her. I could see that despair on her face, masked with indifference. She sat in the corner of that subway car in NYC with her fancy dress coat, silk scarf, and permed hair, as a women who had lost a sense of her worth. This warped self-perception stabbed my heart. 

What did I do? I did not know what to do or say, honestly. 

First, I tried speaking metaphysically about the intrinsic value of life, the irreplaceability of the human person. 

Then, I tried speaking about the gift that my Grandpa, Gaetano, was to me, even though he had terrible dementia and couldn't remember squat. 

But then, I realized, that maybe all I could do, was try to show Sandra, in that moment how she was a gift to me. 

So, I try to show her how her presence meant something to me in that moment. I chatted with Sandra for another 20 minutes until I had to get off at my stop. She told me that she was never married, never had kids, did not have any siblings. She did not tell me anything good about another person in her life-- the only other person she mentioned was her mother, who she spoke about with disgust. She lives alone in a big house in Manhattan with her cats (no joke). My heart was breaking as I spoke with her. It was being torn apart. My heart continues to break at this moment, as I write this. As I looked into her eyes, I saw someone aching for love, someone longing to be seen in her suffering, someone looking for hope, but convincing herself that there was none. 

And while I doubt that my encounter with her changed her life, I know that there was gravity to the grace it was to see Sandra and try to be a loving presence in her hopelessness. 

I think that this wealthy old lady in Manhattan is one of the poorest souls I have met. No sense of self-respect or worth beyond her functionality.

# Harlem's most soulful soul 

Two days later I met Addie May, who may be the richest old woman I have ever met. 

I went with some friends to a nursing home in Brooklyn to visit with the residents there. It was an experience of seeing humanity in its fragility and weakness, in a place of total dependency for care. Some would  say, nursing homes are one of the poorest places in the world, filled with lonely and forgotten. 

I met a few beautiful souls that day, but one which particularly sticks out to me was Addie May, an 89 year old African American woman who was born in Harlem, NY. 

One of the nurses who worked at the nursing home told me to speak with Addie. 

As soon as I approached her, with a simple, "Hi! What is your name?", Addie lit up and let me into her warm heart. 

She began to tell me about her life, her wonderful husband (whom she had lost along with her oldest son), and siblings (11 of them!), and what it was like to grow up in Harlem in the 1930-1940s. 

 Addie May was wheel-chair bound and a woman who had lost both her husband and her son. Yet, her whole person was filled with joy and gratitude to just be alive, despite her difficult circumstances. 

 As I talked with Addie May, I realized that this was a woman who knew what it meant to give her life for others. Not a minute after I met her, she told me that she spent her life as a teacher for troubled kids in Harlem. 

"I was put in charge of the kids who were criminals in the Harlem. They were caught stealing and such. Oh! My principle gave them to me to teach and it was the hardest thing I have ever done!" She had a light in her eyes that expressed deep love for these students. "But it was the best thing I could've done, seeing those kids turn their lives around." 

The smile on her face was contagious. She bore witness to the goodness of life. Addie May told me that she got letters from her students years later thanking her for her support. 

This was wild for me to see: such deep joy in a woman who had clearly known suffering. She had no regrets of giving her life in service to others. The secret to being a good teacher, she said, was to get to know each kid personally and listen to what they say, because sometimes you are the only one who does. Following this advice, she shared the story of one of her students who told Addie May she was being abused at home. Addie May was able to advocate for and get her out of harms way. What a beautiful testament to a life lived for love of others. 

My heart was burning with inspiration as I spoke with Addie May, and burns now as I reflect back on that encounter.

# To live for yourself or others?
It was clear to see that Addie May gave her life in self-less service to others. It was clear that she did not have much, yet she had joy which the rich woman who lives in Manhattan alone with her cats, did not have. 

It was clear to me, that her soul was so rich, that at 89 years old, as she sat in a wheel chair at a nursing home, she was able to speak of the goodness and beauty of life, even amidst the difficulties she faced in her life. And she proclaimed that to me, a twenty-something year old kid, whom she met only minutes before. 

At 89 years old, she still had joy and it was not from forgetting the pain of her life, but rather, from living a life for love of others: for her husband and kids, and for her students. 

In these two encounters, I saw more clearly than ever, that I had a choice to make. 

Either I could live my life in bitterness, believing that all I have to offer the world is my productivity, like Sandra, and die unaware of the gift of myself or the gift of life, or the gift of other people. 

Or I could live a life for other people, in love, in service, and be grateful till the day I die for the gift of life, like Addie May. 

I have to say, I choose the latter. 

I left The Bronx, with a visible picture of bitterness verses gratitude, selfishness vs a giving spirit, and for this I am changed for the better. My hope is that this story inspired you too, to live a life of gratitude and service and love.
