# Welcome to geneVIEVE
Hi! I am Genevieve,the author and creator here at geneVIEVE. 
The idea for this blog started when I was in college. 
My vision for this virtual space is that it can be a place for honest, raw, uplifting and human sharing about my own 
thoughts as I am journeying through life. Therefore, the name "geneVIEVE": gen + LIFE in spanish :)
The dream is that these sharings could bless, inspire, comfort or encourage 
others who are stopping by for a visit. This is life, a pilgrimage! 
Welcome to a tiny window into mine. 
peace as you journey, 
Genevieve
